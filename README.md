[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thestr4ng3r/mymcplus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thestr4ng3r/mymcplus)

mymc+ is a PlayStation 2 memory card manager for to be used with
.ps2 images as created by the PCSX2 emulator for example.

It is based on the classic [mymc](http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca:11068/mymc/)
utility created by Ross Ridge and released as Public Domain.
Changes that have been made from the original code include the following:

* Ported to Python 3 and wxPython Phoenix
* Replaced the natively implemented 3D icon renderer with a cross-platform solution using OpenGL 3.2 Core
* Added support for importing PSV files (as created by the PlayStation 3)
* Added a py.test based test suite
* Many other small refactorings...

Please note that mymc+ is released under the **GPLv3, not Public Domain**!

Here is an overview of most features:

* Read and write the PS2 memory card file system, including extracting and adding files at file system level
* Import save games in MAX Drive (.max), EMS (.psu), SharkPort (.sps), X-Port (.xps), Code Breaker (.cbs) and PSV (.psv) format
* Export save games in MAX Drive (.max) and EMS (.psu) format
* Command line interface
* Optional wxPython based GUI, also displaying the 3D icons
